# Arduino Taipan!

This is the source code used in my Arduino Taipan! port project.

[Taipan!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipan!) was a game on the Apple 2 released in 1982. I reverse engineered the original Apple 2 6502 assembler source code to create my own version on the Arduino.

The original project is described here: [Arduino Taipan](https://web.archive.org/web/20190816231333/http://www.asciimation.co.nz/bb/category/arduino-taipan)

There are two sketches since the project was too large to fit on one Arduino. One runs the game and the keyboard inputs whilst the other controls the display.

This IS NOT a running project. It requires very custom, one-off hardware and uses external libraries not included here. This code is provided purely for interested parties to examine.
